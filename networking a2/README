### Who made this program
j24bains
Note: The code that has been used in this assignment has come from the Textbook "COMPUTER NETWORKING A TOP-DOWN APPROACH (Eighth Eidtion)" and python documentation

### How to run the program
1. 
Run (without the "")
"comm -23 <(seq 1024 65535 | sort) <(ss -tan | awk '{print $4}' | cut -d':' -f2 | grep "[0-9]\{1,5\}" | sort -u) | shuf | head -n 4"
in the terminal to find 4 free ports
the ports will be referred to as A, B, C, D
2. 
where 
    A,B,C,D: are free ports found previously
    x: is the probability of dropping
    d: is the amount of delay between packets
    b: is to turn on or off network_emulators debugging statements

Run script for network emulator without the "", 
Number of parameters: 8

    "./network_emulator.sh A localhost D C localhost B d x b"

3. 
Run script for receiver program (without "")
Number of parameters: 4

    "./receiver.sh localhost C D output.txt

4. 
Where
    to: is the duration before timing out
    input: is the input file to send to receiver (will be copied to output.txt) 
Run script for receiver program (without "")
Number of parameters: 4

    "./sender.sh localhost A B to input



### Test Machines and supported machines
The machine that was used to build the program was j24bains@ubuntu2004-008 and tested using localhost as the host for each program
To use without localhost (across different machines) we would need to find out the IPV4 address on all machines before running
which I am not capable of doing
